      "actual_answer": "### Search Results for What is Python?\n\nThe initial search of the knowledge base yielded 5 documents, but none of them are relevant to \"What is Python?\". The results discuss ASUS copyright information, the Chroma database, a software version release, and instructions for replacing RAM modules in a notebook PC. The relevance scores are all negative, confirming the lack of pertinent information.\n\nGiven the complete irrelevance of these results, I will now formally evaluate the retrieval quality and then perform a web search to find accurate information about Python.\n### Search Results for What is Python?\n\nThe initial search of the internal knowledge base for \"What is Python?\" did not yield any relevant results. The documents retrieved were about ASUS copyright, the Chroma database, a version release, and laptop RAM replacement, all having very low relevance scores. The `evaluate_retrieval_quality` tool confirmed that the retrieval quality was poor and indicated the need for a web search.\n\nTherefore, I will now proceed with a web search to gather accurate information about Python.### Search Results for What is Python?\n\nThe web search for \"What is Python?\" returned 5 results, primarily from ASUS support pages. While these results mention Python in the context of development tools and SDKs (such as Zenbo Junior II's Python SDK, ASUS Aura SDK's Python tutorial, and Tinker Board supporting Python), they do not provide a direct or comprehensive definition of what Python *is* as a programming language. They indicate its *use* in specific ASUS products and platforms but lack a general explanation.\n\nAlthough some context is provided regarding Python's application, a direct definition is still missing. I will now evaluate the quality of these results to determine if another search is necessary, or if I can construct an answer from the available snippets.### Search Results for What is Python?\n\nThe previous web search, although it returned results mentioning Python, did not provide a clear and concise definition of \"What is Python?\". The results were mainly focused on specific ASUS products and their use of Python SDKs. The `evaluate_retrieval_quality` tool confirmed the poor quality of these results and indicated that another web search is needed.\n\nTherefore, I will conduct a new web search with a more precise query to obtain a general definition of Python.### Search Results for What is Python?\n\nMy previous attempt to search the web for \"What is Python definition?\" resulted in an API error (429), meaning the search could not be completed. As I still do not have a clear and comprehensive definition of Python, I need to retry the web search.\n\nI will try the same query and parameters again, hoping for a successful execution this time.### Search Results for What is Python?\n\nThe web search for \"What is Python definition?\" yielded 5 results, again predominantly from ASUS websites. While still product-oriented, these results consistently describe Python as \"a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate...\". Other mentions include its role in various SDKs (like AuraServiceLib) and its presence as a scripting language on devices such as the Tinker Board. Although a comprehensive, in-depth definition is not provided by any single snippet, the core information that Python is a programming language has been established.\n\nI have enough information to proceed with forming a definition, but I will perform one last quality evaluation to formally confirm that no further search is needed before moving to the next stage.### Search Results for What is Python?\n\nMy attempts to retrieve a comprehensive definition for \"What is Python?\" have yielded limited but consistent information:\n\n*   **Internal Knowledge Base Search:** The initial search within the internal knowledge base provided completely irrelevant documents, discussing ASUS copyright, a vector database (Chroma), version releases, and RAM module replacement instructions. The quality evaluation confirmed these results were poor and irrelevant.\n\n*   **Web Search Attempts:**\n    *   The first web search (for \"What is Python?\") returned results mainly from ASUS websites, indicating Python's use in various SDKs (Zenbo Junior II Python SDK, ASUS Aura SDK) and development environments (Tinker Board). These results highlighted Python as a component of development tools but did not offer a general definition.\n    *   A subsequent web search (for \"What is Python definition?\") initially encountered an API error.\n    *   The retried web search with the same query also predominantly returned ASUS-related content. However, several snippets consistently stated: \"**Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate...**\" This provides a core piece of information, even if a more detailed explanation is missing.\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n\nBased on the executed searches, the key takeaway is that **Python is a programming language**. The search results, while heavily biased towards ASUS-specific contexts, consistently identify Python as a programming language used for quick development and integration within various SDKs and platforms like Zenbo Junior II and Tinker Board. A detailed, general-purpose definition of Python beyond its identification as a programming language was not successfully retrieved from the available tools, despite multiple attempts and quality evaluations indicating the need for further search.\n\nGiven that the fundamental nature of Python as a programming language has been established, I will now transfer to the `writer_agent` to formulate an answer based on this information, acknowledging the limitations of the search results in providing a more in-depth definition.Python \u662f\u4e00\u7a2e\u7a0b\u5f0f\u8a9e\u8a00\uff0c\u80fd\u5920\u8b93\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u5feb\u901f\u4f5c\u696d\u4e26\u9032\u884c\u6574\u5408 [1, 2, 3]\u3002\u5b83\u662f\u4e00\u7a2e\u53ef\u7528\u65bc\u8173\u672c\u7de8\u5beb\u7684\u8a9e\u8a00 [5]\u3002\n\nPython \u88ab\u61c9\u7528\u65bc\u591a\u7a2e\u958b\u767c\u74b0\u5883\u548c SDK \u4e2d\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982 Zenbo Junior II \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86 Python SDK [4, 6]\uff0c\u800c\u83ef\u78a9 Aura SDK v3.1 \u4e5f\u652f\u63f4 Python \u8173\u672c\uff0c\u8b93\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u80fd\u8f15\u9b06\u904b\u7528\u5176\u529f\u80fd [5]\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cTinker Board \u5e73\u53f0\u4e5f\u652f\u63f4 Python [1, 2, 3]\u3002\n\n### \u53c3\u8003\u4f86\u6e90\nPython \u662f\u4e00\u7a2e\u7a0b\u5f0f\u8a9e\u8a00\uff0c\u80fd\u5920\u8b93\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u5feb\u901f\u4f5c\u696d\u4e26\u9032\u884c\u6574\u5408 [1, 2, 3]\u3002\u5b83\u662f\u4e00\u7a2e\u53ef\u7528\u65bc\u8173\u672c\u7de8\u5beb\u7684\u8a9e\u8a00 [5]\u3002\n\nPython \u88ab\u61c9\u7528\u65bc\u591a\u7a2e\u958b\u767c\u74b0\u5883\u548c SDK \u4e2d\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982 Zenbo Junior II \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86 Python SDK [4, 6]\uff0c\u800c\u83ef\u78a9 Aura SDK v3.1 \u4e5f\u652f\u63f4 Python \u8173\u672c\uff0c\u8b93\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u80fd\u8f15\u9b06\u904b\u7528\u5176\u529f\u80fd [5]\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cTinker Board \u5e73\u53f0\u4e5f\u652f\u63f4 Python [1, 2, 3]\u3002\n\n### \u53c3\u8003\u4f86\u6e90\n[1] Tinker Board\uff5cAIoT & Industrial Solution\uff5cASUS Middle East.

      "actual_answer": "### Search Results for How to bake a pizza...\nThe initial search in the internal knowledge base for \"How to bake a pizza\" returned 5 documents. However, these documents are entirely irrelevant to the query. They appear to be excerpts from a \"Service Manual\" for a \"Notebook PC\", discussing steps like removing compartment covers, disconnecting batteries, and replacing computer components (RAM, M.2 SSD, antennas). There is no information about baking pizza in these results.\n\nGiven the complete irrelevance of the internal knowledge base results, I will now proceed to evaluate the quality of these results and then perform a web search to find relevant information on how to bake a pizza.### Search Results for How to bake a pizza...\nThe evaluation confirms that the previous internal knowledge base search results for \"How to bake a pizza\" were of \"poor\" quality and entirely irrelevant to the query. The system has determined that a web search is necessary to find appropriate information. I will now perform a web search to retrieve relevant instructions on how to bake a pizza.### Search Results for How to bake a pizza...\nBoth the internal knowledge base search and the initial web search for \"How to bake a pizza\" have failed to produce any relevant results. The knowledge base returned documents about computer service manuals, and the web search returned zero results. This means I currently have no information to answer the user's query.\n\nGiven the complete lack of relevant retrieval results, I need to escalate this to the `reviewer_agent`. The `reviewer_agent` is responsible for evaluating the sufficiency of the retrieved information and determining the next course of action, which might include refining the search strategy or informing the user about the lack of information.### Search Results for How to bake a pizza...\nDespite multiple attempts, both the internal knowledge base and web searches for \"How to bake a pizza\" have failed to retrieve any relevant documents. The internal knowledge base provided irrelevant computer service manual content, and all web searches returned zero results.\n\nAt this point, I have exhausted my current search capabilities for this specific query. Since I am unable to find any information on how to bake a pizza, I must transfer this back to the `reviewer_agent` for further assessment. It's possible the `reviewer_agent` might need to consider alternative strategies or inform the user about the inability to find information.The current search results are completely insufficient as no relevant documents were found after multiple attempts by the `search_agent` using both internal knowledge base and web search. The `search_agent` has consistently returned zero relevant results for \"How to bake a pizza\".\n\nGiven the persistent failure to retrieve any information for a common query, it suggests a potential issue with the search capabilities for this specific topic or a systemic problem. Therefore, instead of repeatedly asking the `search_agent` to perform the same failing task, I will transfer control back to the `orchestrator_agent`. The `orchestrator_agent` can then reassess the overall strategy, potentially modify the approach, or determine if this query is unanswerable with the current tools.\u5f88\u62b1\u6b49\uff0c\u6211\u7121\u6cd5\u627e\u5230\u95dc\u65bc\u5982\u4f55\u70d8\u7119\u62ab\u85a9\u7684\u76f8\u95dc\u8cc7\u8a0a\u3002\u5118\u7ba1\u9032\u884c\u4e86\u591a\u6b21\u641c\u5c0b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5167\u90e8\u77e5\u8b58\u5eab\u548c\u7db2\u8def\u641c\u5c0b\uff0c\u4f46\u90fd\u6c92\u6709\u8fd4\u56de\u4efb\u4f55\u76f8\u95dc\u7d50\u679c\u3002\u6211\u76ee\u524d\u7121\u6cd5\u56de\u7b54\u60a8\u7684\u554f\u984c\u3002",
